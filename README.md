### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Fletcher. By day I work as a software engineer for Belle Tire. By night, I'm a father to two littles, a husband, and a dog owner. I'm also co-owner of a new software startup that builds custom business applications. My technologies/languages of choice are Asp.Net Core and C#; I've worked with others but that's my bread and butter!
